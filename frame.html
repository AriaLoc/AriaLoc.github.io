          <h1>The ORIGINS</h1>
          <p>peration Open Heart has been an integral part of this unit and has shouldered this burned for the last 24yrs.
          Especially in its early beginnings when there was no unit but just the visiting Cardiac teams that would come on a yearly bases and conduct operations here in PNG.
          with the Paediatric cardiologiest working hand in hand with them in the screening and preparation of pediatric patients for these visiting teams to come and operate.
          They arrived with their own team of surgeons, anaesthetists, intensivists, perfusionists, nurses and physiotherapists.
          This began first at the Goroka base Hospital and then later was brought down to Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH).
          The unit began with (late) Dr Lunn who graduated in 2012 as our first national Cardiothoracic surgeon.
          Then later Dr Tapaua joined the team in 2014 after spending 2yrs at the Singapore National Heart Center.</p>
          <p>At present we are now more multi-disiplinary constituting Surgeons, Anaesthetists, Perfusionists, Paediatric cardiologist, Adult cardiologist, physiotherapist, Social Workers, etc...
          With a team base attitude we as a unit are moving forward and by the year 2017 plan to start our own national team Open Heart Operations.</p>
