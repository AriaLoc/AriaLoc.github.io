            <h2>Cardiac Surgery</h2>
            <h3>Open Heart</h3>
              <p>Initially open heart operations where done on a yearly bases by a visiting Australian team over a 1-2 week period.
              Now for the last 2 years there is also a visiting surgical cardiac team from Singapore doing adult cardiac surgery.
              The frequency of visits are now two (2) Australian team visits and two(2) Singapore and the emphasis is more on teaching and passing down of skills then services delivery.
              This change of method is the need for our national team to take over all open heart operations. </p>

              <p>The most common cases that have been done are: <br>
              1. ASD & VSD repair <br>
              2. TOF Shunting (Blalock Taussig shunt)+/- repair <br>
              3. Valve repair +/- replacement <br>
              </p>

            <h3>Closed Heart Surgery</h3>

              <p>Currently for the last three (3) years we the national have taken over completely the closed heart operations and
              carry our these operations in our normal weekly operation lists when the patients present to hospital,
              unlike before having to wait for the Australian cardiac team.</p>
              <p>Most common closed heart surgery done here is PDA ligation.
              </p>

                </figure2>

            <h3>Permanent Pacemaker insertion</h3>
              <p>We are currently the only hospital in the country placing permanent pacemakers and also programing them.
              The national team alone have placed about 20 pacemaker from 2012 to the end of 2016
              <br>
              It still remains quiet costly for the regular Papua New Guinean to pay for a Permanent Pacemaker though half the cost is subsidized by Operation Open Heart PNG
              and is still only half to about three quarters (3/4) the cost if a patient were to travel out of the country.</p>
