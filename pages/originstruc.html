            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <h3>Operation Open Heart Papua New Guinea</h3>

            <p>
            Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a population of well over 7.5 million in the 2007 census and like other developing countries; cardiothoracic pathologies poses a significant problem with high incidence of both congenital and acquired heart diseases and general thoracic pathologies including trauma related problems similar to the 	Western countries.  Many patients with cardiac or thoracic related surgical 	problems are either being attended to by general surgeons who can only	do what they 	can, wait for the Australian cardiac visiting team who visit the country once a year 	or offer palliative medical treatment.
            The few who are able to afford treatment overseas pay their own way to other countries for this service including Australia 	and Singapore.</p>

<p>The history of cardiac and cardiothoracic service in Papua New Guinea dates back to the pre-independence era where Australian Cardiologists and Cardiothoracic Surgeons made several visits to the country and treated Papua New Guineans. The mortality however was as high as 4.5% and was mainly attributed to the lack of back up facilities 	and local expertise.  Seeing the need the country had at that time, a small cardiothoracic 	unit was established in Lae only to close down after PNG gained independence in 1975 	as expatriates left.
From that time to 1990s selected patients were sent to Australia for treatment but this program did not last due to lack of financial support and more importantly it was expensive.</p>

<p>Between 1956 and 1971 an unspecified number of cardiothoracic visits by expatriates were made to Lae and Rabaul.
A unit was then established at the Angau Memorial hospital in Lae between 1972 to 1974 and visiting teams continued to visit the country.
The cardiothoracic unit however, closed down soon after independence in 1975 due to the exodus of expatriates and from 1975 to 1977 there was adhoc referrals to Australia of selected patients for cardiac surgery that saw only a few patients benefiting.</p>

<p>Outlined below is the summary history of cardiothoracic surgery in Papua New Guinea (PNG) before and soon after independence to the present time.
<br>
1. 1955: Medical personal realized the need to establish a cardiothoracic unit due to high prevalence of TB affecting both the heart and lungs. Dr John Gunter negotiated assistance from the Australian Thoracic Surgical Society
2. 1956: First 3 teams visited PNG and performed various thoracic surgeries
3. 1966: Twenty teams had visited PNG. 716 operations performed on 623 patients with a total cost of AUD$300,000.00 over the 10 years. Mortality rate was 4.5%
4. 1966: In June the last cardiothoracic team visit to PNG
5. 1967-1970: Only Cardiologist visited and selected patients to have surgery in Australia
6. 1971-1974: A small cardiothoracic unit was established in Lae hospital but closed after 1975.
7. 1974-1977: No more Cardiology visits and the cardiothoracic unit ceased operation
8. 1978-1983: Ad hoc arrangement for patients to have surgery in Australia
9. 1988-1990: Royal Alexandra children’s hospital (Australia) started accepting patients for cardiac surgery.
10. 1992: The program with the Royal Alexandra children’s hospital ceased due to no funds. A total of 133 patients benefited from this program.
11. 1993: Operation Open Heart (OOH) commenced its visits to PNG organized by the Sydney Adventist hospital through its Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) program.
12. 2013: From its inception in 1993 to this year (19 years, 1997 excluded), 815 Papua New Guineans have benefited from the OOH program and the overall mortality rate for the OOH program is 2.08%.
13. 2013: The Singapore Cardiothoracic team commenced their visit to PNG and successfully operated on six adult cardiac patients with no mortality.</p>

<p>The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) came to our rescue from 1993 up to this date and ever since they have been coming to PNG to do life saving cardiac surgical procedures to some of our people.
Last year the Singapore Cardiac team joined in and visited PMGH where they assisted our local team do cardiac surgery on six adult Papua New Guineans.
Each year more than 600 cardiac patients are screened for the visits and based on the strict selection criteria, only 50 to 60 patients are selected for surgical treatment but only 46 patients on average are able to have their surgical procedures done.
This means that majority of the patients will have to wait for another year if they are lucky to make it or just continue on medication alone, hence the waiting list for cardiac surgery has been on the rise.
The mortality rate for these visits is less 	than 2% that is comparable to international standards.</p>

<p>The average cost of hosting these cardiac visits in PNG is between PGK 200,000.00 to PGK 300,000.00 (AUD77,619.00 to AUD116,429.00) to treat an average of 46 patients per visit each year.
This is the cost of sending only one patient for cardiac surgery in 	Australia. The cost of doing one cardiac operation in PNG is between PGK4,347.00 to PGK6,521.00 (AUD1,687.00 to AUD2,530.00) which is more affordable for our people.
Hence the need for this service in the country is very obvious that the primary focus for the external visiting cardiac teams has now shifted from being service provision to training a local cardiac and cardiothoracic team.
It is of no doubt very expensive to set 	up this Centre but this is a short-term sacrifice for a long-term gain for our people and the country as a whole and the PNG Government must to take full ownership in its 	annual budget to establish the Unit and sustain it.</p>

<p>A catchment area of more than 200,000 people is one of the requirements for a cardiothoracic unit and the two main capital cities of PNG (Port Moresby and Lae) are well qualified with more than 400,000 population in the last census.
An established cardiothoracic specialist service in the country on the same note is well overdue and considerable planning, equipment and resources is required to set it up but once established, the economic advantage is irrefutable.
This means that the National Government takes ownership of this service and includes it in every calendar budget as history has shown that adhoc funding will not sustain it.
Such institution is noted in many countries as a surrogate for a high standard of tertiary health service as with it, comes the modern equipments for investigations such as CT and PET scans, MRI and dialysis machine to name a few as well as a good pathology backup and research.
The cardiothoracic services are often used as one of the yard sticks for accreditation for many hospitals in the developed countries worldwide.</p>
